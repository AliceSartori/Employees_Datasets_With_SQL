Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s (Folder 'New Data').
All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

Data Engineering

Data Analysis

As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. To confirm my suspiction, I imported the SQL database into Pandas to investigate.
